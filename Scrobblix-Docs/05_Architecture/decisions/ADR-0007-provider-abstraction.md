## Status

Accepted

## Context

Scrobblix requires a durable decision for this cross-cutting concern. The decision must optimize reliability, security, native Windows integration, maintainability, and a realistic solo-maintainer delivery path.

## Decision

Define provider-neutral application contracts for authentication health, now playing, scrobble batch, love, and unlove while preserving provider-specific payload/response data in infrastructure. This enables testing and later providers without designing a premature universal protocol.

## Consequences

- Implementation and documentation must follow this decision while it remains accepted.
- Reversal requires a superseding ADR, migration impact, and updated tests/requirements.
- Dependencies introduced by the decision are pinned and reviewed through the engineering process.
